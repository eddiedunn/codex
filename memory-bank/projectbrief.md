# Project Brief

This project is a CLI-based agent framework designed to interact with external tools and data sources. The current goal is to add Model Context Protocol (MCP) client capabilities, enabling the agent to leverage tools from the MCP ecosystem via the official TypeScript SDK.

## Core Requirements

- Robust agent loop with tool invocation (shell, exec, etc.)
- Extensible architecture for new tool types
- Add MCP client support for tool discovery and invocation

## Scope

- Integrate MCP TypeScript SDK
- Enable agent to discover and use MCP tools
- Document all integration steps and design decisions
