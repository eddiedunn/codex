## MCP Client Test Integration: Debugging Session (April 19, 2025)

### Current Focus
- Unblocking persistent test failures for MCP client integration, specifically around mocking and argument handling in agent loop tests.
- Isolating the root cause of why Vitest mocks are not being triggered in the main project, despite all best-practice workarounds.

### Recent Progress
- Confirmed that argument handling and error management in agent-loop.ts is robust.
- Cleared Vitest cache and verified no global setup files or helpers interfere with mocking.
- Performed a minimal reproduction with a local dummy module: mocking works as expected.
- Performed a minimal reproduction with the actual MCP client wrapper: mocking also works as expected.
- The main project still fails to mock MCP client, but minimal repros prove Vitest and the SDK are not the root cause.

### Key Findings
- The persistent mocking issue is unique to the main projectâ€™s structure, import order, or test runner config.
- There is likely a hidden or transitive import of the MCP client before the mock is registered in the test file.
- The MCP SDK is CJS and has known ESM compatibility issues, but this does not block mocking in isolation.

### Next Steps
1. Audit the main project for any transitive imports or helpers that load the MCP client before the test mock is registered.
2. Consider dependency injection or runtime patching as a workaround if the import order cannot be fixed.
3. Optionally, upgrade Vitest to the latest version for improved isolation and mocking.
4. Summarize all findings and recommendations in the memory bank for future reference.
